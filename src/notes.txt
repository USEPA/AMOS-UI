This was from chapter 2, video 16.  It was for making API calls with dynamic routes; I'm gonna need this for my app.

methods: {
      async initData(){
        const response = await fetch(`https://travel-dummy-api.netlify.app/${this.$route.params.slug}`)
        this.destination = await response.json()
      }
    },
    async created() {
        this.initData()
    }
